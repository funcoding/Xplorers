Xplorers
========
Xplorers is my first social networking site build using PHP and MYSQL.
<br>
This site was built to try out PHP and MYSQL after learning them in theory. The site was built for my friends who wanted a simple social network site.
<br>
Currently the site supports only simple features such as uploading profile pic, adding comments, replying to comments and deleting them. Since every person is known to each other, friend request feature hasn't been introduced yet.
